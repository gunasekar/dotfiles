# ShellCheck configuration file
# Documentation: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki

# Disable specific checks that are intentional in this codebase

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# We dynamically source files, which is intentional
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced files
# We source files that may not exist in all environments
disable=SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Some exports are used by child processes
disable=SC2034

# SC2154: Variable is referenced but not assigned
# Some variables come from sourced files
disable=SC2154

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Our simple variable declarations don't need this
disable=SC2155

# SC1083: Literal closing brace in one-liner conditionals
# Pattern like: [[ condition ]] && { echo "error"; return }
# This is intentional and works correctly
disable=SC1083

# SC2046: Quote command substitutions to prevent word splitting
# Common pattern throughout codebase: $(whoami), $(pass key), etc.
# While best practice is to quote, these are safe in our context
disable=SC2046

# SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references
# Style preference - ${var} vs $var
disable=SC2250

# SC2001: Prefer parameter expansion over sed
# Style suggestion - sometimes sed is clearer
disable=SC2001

# SC2292: Prefer [[ ]] over [ ] for tests
# Style preference - both work fine in bash
disable=SC2292

# SC2312: Consider invoking command separately to avoid masking return value
# Informational - acceptable in most cases
disable=SC2312

# Enable all optional checks
enable=all

# Set shell dialect (can be overridden per-file with shebang)
shell=bash

# Additional directives
# - Warn about unquoted variables (already default, but emphasizing)
# - Check for deprecated syntax
